Hello, and welcome to my Final Project for the Parsons MPS CD Typography and Interaction II class! 

As a VERY indecisive person, I explored how to create a function and interactive "What Should Hye Lynn Eat?" Generator. 

In this project, I used HTML, CSS (including some fun CSS animations), and JS.

I hope you enjoy and also find a meal you might want to try!
